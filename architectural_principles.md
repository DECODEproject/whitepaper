participation.
- **Flexibility** through smart rules, driven by the needs of the usecases.
- **Transparency** and **auditability** of collective action and choice, privacy
of individual actions.
- **High-integrity**, appropriate **privacy** options, and **availability** against
disruption and suppression.
- **User-friendliness** for end-users, and app developers for **easy
adoption**.
