# Smart rules Engine

What we call "Smart Rules" in DECODE are a computable [@sober1978computability] sociolect [@louwerse2004semantic] that can be parsed into a semantic model referred to a finite ontology and executed by a distributed computing cluster. It is of central importance to grant participants the access to such a language and clear understanding of what it expresses and of the consequences of its execution.

The open nature of the smart rules is extremely important when compared to the popularization of "sharing economies" that apply mostly unknown rules that are opaque to the participants and undemocratically adjusted by third parties who are not participating in the economy, but in most cases just profiting from it.

The DECODE project plans the development of a language for "smart-rules" that is not conceived to stay behind the scenes, but to be understood and modified: this a different approach to data management rather than CRUD-type interaction, an approach that is also necessitated by the distributed and write once immutable nature of blockchain technologies.

The underpinnings of the smart rules implementation are explained in depth in the forthcoming deliverable D3.3 "Data Privacy and Smart Language requirements, its  initial set of smart rules and related ontology".
