# Conclusion

This paper has presented the architecture for the DECODE project, and innovative proposal for a decentralised application framework that focuses specifically on data privacy and entitlements. It combines state of the art cryptographic techniques and evolves the concepts found in distributed ledgers to contribute to the growing need for people to have more control of who has access to their data and more transparency over who is using it and for what purpose.

We have demonstrated the core components of the architecture and the principles and foundational concepts on which it is built, completing the picture with illustrative examples of how DECODE can be applied to real world scenarios.

The DECODE project is specifically target to applying the latest innovations in technology to the good of citizens and furthering a socially beneficial agenda as opposed to the centralisation and exploitation of individuals through their data that is rife in the modern world.

The ongoing evolution of the architecture will be documented via a set of public whitepapers that will be published on the [DECODE website](https://decodeproject.eu/) and notifications will be made via twitter (https://twitter.com/decodeproject (https://twitter.com/decodeproject)).
