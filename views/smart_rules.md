# Smart rules Engine

What we call "Smart Rules" in DECODE are a computable
[@sober1978computability] sociolect [@louwerse2004semantic] that can
be parsed into a semantic model referred to a finite ontology and
executed by a distributed computing cluster. It is of central
importance to grant participants the access to such a language and
clear understanding of what it expresses and of the consequences of
its execution.

The open nature of the smart rules is extremely important when
compared to the popularization of "sharing economies" that apply
mostly unknown rules that are opaque to the participants and
undemocratically adjusted by third parties who are not participating
in the economy, but in most cases just profiting from it.

The DECODE project plans the development of a language for
"smart-rules" that is not conceived to stay behind the scenes, but to
be understood and modified: this a different approach to data
management rather than CRUD-type interaction, an approach that is also
necessitated by the distributed and write once immutable nature of
blockchain technologies.

DECODE's "smart rules" language is conceived as a trust framework
which is both usable (can be executed) and expressive (can be
understood) to encode smart rules and contracts relating to the
governance of personal and other data in the DECODE architecture. The
possibility to understand and not only to execute a language is of
paramount importance to allow algorithmic sovereignty
[@Roio2017AlgoSov]. Algorithms are law [@lessig1999code] in their own
specific domain and just as law they must be subject to reviews,
critiques and transformations according to societal needs and
techno-political negotiations.

The objective is to achieve compliance with privacy regulations and
digital right by converging them in a usable and expressive integrated
approach (crossing the domains of social, legal, economic and
technical modeling) formalised by smart rules that represent social
contracts and entitlements. The design of the smart rules language
should promote clarity and avoid ambiguities. The rules should ensure
the respect of the decisions of the data owner (for example, citizens,
or the city administration or an organisation processing data) as well
regulations and legal obligations on application providers.

The data management and policy enforcement according to rules is
defined by the user interacting directly with rules or with a
facilitate abstraction of them, graphically representing their flow,
facilitating progressive level of understanding by all participants.

- User interface and visual languages

## Deterministic and proovable computation


- a language to express rules
- Ricardian contracts?
