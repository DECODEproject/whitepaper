Today's Internet and digital platforms are becoming increasingly centralised, slowing innovation and challenging their potential to revolutionise society and the economy in a pluralistic manner. The DECODE project will develop practical alternatives, through the creation, evaluation and demonstration of a distributed and open architecture for managing online access and aggregation of private information to allow a citizen-friendly and privacy-aware governance of access entitlements. Strong ethical and digital rights principles are at the base of DECODE's mission, moving towards the implementation of open standards for a technical architecture resting on the use of Attribute Based Cryptography, Distributed ledgers, a secure operating system and a privacy focused smart rules language.
