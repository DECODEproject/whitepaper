# DECODE Applications

## What is a DECODE application?

A DECODE application is application capable of interacting with the DECODE nodes, constituting the main endpoint for human interaction with DECODE.

DECODE will test and evaluate four pilot/trials in Amsterdam and Barcelona following a lean and agile methodology. 

DECODE use-cases to be evaluated with pilots:

- **Open democracy**: this use case builds on the D-CENT project, which developed decentralised democracy applications used by thousands of citizens across Europe. It demonstrated how viable distributed systems can foster the next generation of democracy tools and open policy making. DECODE's Barcelona pilot will go a step beyond by making data available and easily accessible by citizens, fostering informed collective decision-making.
- **Data aggregation dashboard** : Providing access to crowdsourced information about the city to foster informed and deliberative decision-making.
- **Collaborative economy / Hospitality** : Providing a new model where the data platform is the new middleman. The data is the raw resource through which value is created, enabling businesses to offer better and better services, which in turn generates more accurate data in a closed ecosystem.
- **Participatory citizen sensing / IoT**: T Facilitates an open, secure and privacy-aware market place of distributed, wireless  sensors and actuators in which every citizen can participate, fostering a smart, IoT enabled city from the ground up. The pilot facilitates an open, secure and privacy-aware ecosystem of distributed, wireless sensors and actuators in which every citizen can participate, fostering an IOT enabled city from the ground up.

## Application Ecosystem


### Application operators

 is transparent to a known and registered organisation that a participant can discover and make a choice about wether to interact with or provide data to. For example an app mayb be operated by a company which will be required to be registered in the civic records for a city / country and a link made between the app, the operator and such records. In the uk there is the example of Companies house which can be accessed via a URL, for eg https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04091535.


## Example - Participatory Democracy through Petitions

- How to use ABC to be private
- Include token to prevent double voting in ABC
- ABC issued from authority e.g. City of Paris
- Use of category counters to get aggregate statistics without sharing data (e.g. I just need to tick the age group, not share my date of birth, the smart rules can do this for me) can still decide wether or not I want to even do that
- Verification of the petition afterwards by some authority - makes it valuable in order to contribute in some meaningful way to a formal process
- Not yet at the same level as a legal vote - requires many more legal constraints

## Example - IOT entitlements

- Contributing IOT data from my devices
- Include use of device up to add ontology data
- Options for securing access (including just securing access to the stream via ABC)
- Still a topic of research and evolution

##Â Example - Peer verified credentials

Would allow access control to private groups of people where membership of the group is granted by peer support

- the P2P issuer scenario 
- A group of people together form a "decentralised Issuer"
- Research topic 
- A simple model would be to nominate "administrators"
- Isnt this just a contract implementation that can generate a credential if x number of signatories who also have the credential support the candidate?

## Example - Data commons?

Should we come up with something here or leave it till a next iteration of WP?


```comment
TODO: description of 1-2 use cases once the first pilot in Amsterdam and Barcelona are selected, e.g. collaborative economy/hospitality (FairBnB) and participatory citizen sensing (Things Network, Fitbit)*
```

3 exemplar use cases / demo apps:

- A) Citizen Sensing - Air quality for a location
- B) Asset sharing / renting (TBD, equivalent of FairBnB)
- C) Complex privacy (TBD, either in terms of participants or varying based on context)
