## What is a DECODE application?
## Application Ecosystem


### Application operators

 is transparent to a known and registered organisation that a participant can discover and make a choice about wether to interact with or provide data to. For example an app mayb be operated by a company which will be required to be registered in the civic records for a city / country and a link made between the app, the operator and such records. In the uk there is the example of Companies house which can be accessed via a URL, for eg https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04091535.
