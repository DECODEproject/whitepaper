# Outline

This documents describes the design of the DECODE ([https://decodeproject.eu/](https://decodeproject.eu/)) architecture. The document will evolve over time and will be published regularly as a versioned series.

The whitepaper is structured as follows. We first describe the functionality the architecture should implement, together with the main non-functional requirements. We then give a high-level description of the conceptual foundations that are brought together, before digging deeper and discussing the main components. We describe the function and responsibility of these and how they relate to each other. We then discuss what kind of applications can be built with DECODE and provide some examples.


# Introduction to DECODE

## What is DECODE and why is it important?

DECODE is an evolution of the concept of [decentralised systems](section-link) which leverages state of the art cryptographic techniques such as [Distributed Ledgers](section-link) and [Attribute Based Credentials](section-link) to build a system that provides its [participants](glossary-link) the capability to store data securely, give control and transparency over with whom and for what purpose data is shared and transact with other participants or  organisations.


DECODE aims to design and implement a free and open source, reliable and distributed architecture to run applications developed by third parties.

The DECODE architecture must be secure, distributed and privacy
friendly as it will host different privacy sensitive applications in
parallel.

### DECODE is made of:

- a set of specifications for distributed ledgers to support decode
- a free and open source reference implementation of a distributed ledger
- a smart rule language that can be translated and graphically represented
- a GNU/Linux based operating system that can execute signed smart rule applications
- the documentation needed for operators to write and deploy smart rules that request access to private data
- an intuitive graphical interface for participants to allow smart rules to access their private data
- an ontology of attributes for private data that is aggregated by operators
- an attribute based cryptographic implementation that can grant access to data


###Â DECODE main goals are:

- allow *participants* to manage access to their *private data*, by granting and revoke access to parts
- allow *operators* to write *smart rules* sign them and get the authorisation to run them on DECODE
- allow *smart rules* to access *private data* based on *entitlements* and matched *attributes*
- allow everyone to record *entitlements* on a *distributed ledger* whose integrity is resilient and verifiable

TODO: description of 1-2 use cases once the first pilot in Amsterdam and Barcelona are selected, e.g. collaborative economy/hospitality (FairBnB) and participatory citizen sensing (Things Network, Fitbit)*
```

3 exemplar use cases / demo apps:

- A) Citizen Sensing - Air quality for a location
- B) Asset sharing / renting (TBD, equivalent of FairBnB)
- C) Complex privacy (TBD, either in terms of participants or varying based on context)
